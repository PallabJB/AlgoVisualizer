# 🔍 AlgoVisualizer

**AlgoVisualizer** is an interactive web application that visually demonstrates the working of pathfinding and sorting algorithms. This project helps users better understand algorithmic logic by watching them in action — step-by-step, with clear animations, pathfinding metrics (like time and nodes visited), and sorting details (like swaps and comparisons).

## ✨ Features

### 🧠 Pathfinding Visualizer
- Create a grid/maze with custom obstacles.
- Visualize how different algorithms explore nodes and find the shortest path.
- Measure the performance via:
  - Total visited nodes
  - Path length
  - Time taken (in milliseconds)

### 📊 Sorting Visualizer
- Observe how various sorting algorithms behave on randomized data.
- Metrics shown:
  - Number of comparisons
  - Number of swaps
  - Execution time
